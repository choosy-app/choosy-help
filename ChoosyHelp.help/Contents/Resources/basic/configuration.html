	<h1>Choosy Help: Configuration guide</h1>

	<p>A step by step guide to setting up Choosy.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<h2>Set Choosy as your default browser</h2>
			<p>
				The first thing to do is to tell macOS that it should use Choosy as the
				default browser. This will allow Choosy to receive links you click on
				and decide which browser to send them to.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whenever Choosy isn't set as your default browser, it will display a
				prompt at the bottom of the settings window:
			</p>

			<img 
				src="../images/basic_configuration_default.png" 
				alt="A screenshot of Choosy's default browser prompt"
				width="601" height="66" />

			<p>
				You can change also your macOS default browser any time in the macOS
				System Preferences app.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Browsers</h2>
			<p>
				Next, set up the list of browsers that you want Choosy to use. When you
				first install Choosy the browser list will be populated with all the
				browsers that macOS knows are installed on your system. This list won't
				be perfect: it might include some apps that aren't really browsers, but
				happen to be able to open links; it might be missing some browsers,
				especially if you have more than one version of the same browser
				installed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <strong>order of the browser list</strong> is important: they
				should be in order of preference, with the browser you'd most often
				like to use at the top. When we configure Choosy's rules, any settings
				that refer to the &ldquo;favourite&rdquo; browser are talking about
				the browser at the top of the list. Similarly settings that talk about
				the &ldquo;best running browser&rdquo; are referring to the running
				browser that is highest up the list.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are more details on how to edit your browsers list in the
				<a href="../settings/browsers.html">browser settings</a> section.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Rules</h2>
			<p>
				Next we should configure some rules. Rules tell Choosy what to do when
				you open a link. Each rule has two parts: the <i>conditions</i> when
				Choosy will apply the rule, and Choosy's <i>behaviour</i> when the rule
				is applied.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, here's one of the default rules that Choosy sets up for
				you when first installed:
			</p>

			<img 
				src="../images/basic_configuration_rule.png" 
				alt="A screenshot of Choosy's rule editor, showing one of the default rules"
				width="640" height="355" />

			<p>
				The condition for this rule is that some of the browsers in your browser
				list must be running. When that condition is met, the behaviour is for
				Choosy to prompt you to select from one of the running browsers.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <strong>order of the rules list</strong> is important: Choosy will
				try the rules in order, and use the first one where the conditions are
				met. The last rule in the list is specialâ€”it defines the default
				behaviour that will be used when no other rule is appropriate.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are more details about creating and editing rules in the
				<a href="../settings/rules.html">rules settings</a> section.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Browser plugins</h2>
			<p>
				If you want to use Choosy's functionality from inside your browser
				there are a variety of browser plugins and bookmarklets that you can
				install. There is more information in the
				<a href="../misc/browsers.html">browser integration</a> section.
