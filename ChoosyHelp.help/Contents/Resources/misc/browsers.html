	<h1>Choosy Help: Browser integration</h1>

	<p>There are two main ways of using Choosy's functionality from within your browser:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#extensions">Browser extensions</a></li>
		<li><a href="#bookmarklets">Bookmarklets</a></li>
	</ul>

	<div id="extensions">
		<h2>Browser extensions</h2>
		<p>
			Browser extensions allow you to open a link from one browser in another.
			When you have a Choosy browser extension installed, your browser will
			gain two features:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				A Choosy button in the browser's menu bar, which will open the Choosy
				prompt for the page that's currently open.
			</li>
			<li>
				A Choosy option in the menu when you right-click on a link, so you can
				open that link in a different browser.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Extensions are available for <i>Safari</i>, <i>Google Chrome</i>,
			<i>Firefox</i> and <i>Opera</i>. How they are installed and configured
			varies from browser to browser.
		</p>

		<h3>Safari</h3>
		<p>
			Choosy has a built-in Safari App Extension, which means that the Safari
			extension is installed and ready to go as soon as you launch Choosy
			(v2.1 or later).
		</p>
		<p>
			Safari App Extensions are disabled by default, so before you can use it
			you will need to enable it in the Safari preferences:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Launch Safari</li>
			<li>
				Open the preferences, either from the <kbd>Safari</kbd> menu, or by
				pressing <kbd><kbd>cmd</kbd><kbd>,</kbd></kbd>
			</li>
			<li>
				Select the <kbd>Extensions</kbd> tab
			</li>
			<li>Check the box next to <i>Choosy</i> in the list of extensions</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Google Chrome</h3>
		<p>
			Google Chrome allows third-party apps, like Choosy, to automatically
			install an extension from the Chrome Web Store.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you first launch Choosy (v2.1 or later), it will install a
			configuration file telling Google Chrome where to find the Choosy
			extension.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next time you restart Google Chrome, you will be prompted to enable
			the extension.
		</p>
		<p>
			After that initial prompt, if you want to enable or disable the Choosy
			extension in Chrome, you can visit <code>chrome://extensions</code>
			in Google Chrome.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you remove the extension from Google Chrome, Choosy won't attempt
			to reinstall it. If you change your mind, you can find the
			<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/choosy/baecahhpgcpccohoeipmdkkbemhjhfmc">
				Choosy extension in the Chrome Web Store</a>.
		</p>

		<h3>Firefox &amp; Opera</h3>
		<p>
			Firefox and Opera both support extensions, but recommend that third-party
			apps, like Choosy, don't attempt to install them automatically.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can find links to these extensions on the
			<a href="https://choosy.app/browsers">Choosy web site's browsers page</a>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="bookmarklets">
		<h2>Bookmarklets</h2>
		<p>Bookmarklets are links that you can add to the bookmarks bar of a browser. Rather than linking a web page they run a small script.  The Choosy bookmarklets allow you to open the page you are currently looking at in another browser using Choosy.  They don't provide as much integration as extensions, but they will work the same in almost any browser.</p>
		<p>You can find the <a href="https://choosy.app/browsers#bookmarklets">bookmarklets on the Choosy web site</a> and drag them into your browser's bookmarks bar from there.</p>
