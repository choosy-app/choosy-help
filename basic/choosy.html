	<h1>Choosy Help: What is Choosy?</h1>
	
	<h2>A smarter default browser</h2>
	<p>
		When you click on a link outside of your web browser it opens in your default web browser. If you use more
		than one web browser on a regular basis having a single default web browser can be very restrictive. That's
		where Choosy comes in: Instead of having a single default browser Choosy opens links in the best browser.
	</p>
	
	<h2>How does Choosy decide which browser to use?</h2>
	<p>
		In some situations Choosy will display a prompt and allow you to select from a list of browsers. In other
		situations Choosy will automatically select which browser. Exactly what happens is completely based on your
		settings. Your <a href="../settings/advanced.html">advanced behaviour rules</a> will be applied first, and
		then if none of them matched your <a href="../settings/behaviour.html">standard behaviours</a> will be
		applied.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're setting Choosy up for the first time, have a look at the 
		<a href="../basic/configuration.html">configuration guide</a>.
