	<h1>Choosy Help: Web address rules</h1>
	
	<p>
		You can create advanced behaviour rules that are triggered by clicking on a link to a web
		address that matches certain criteria.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The following types of web address matching are availble:
	</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>is</dt>
		<dd>
			Matches the whole URL exactly. Note that this includes the protocol at the start of the URL (e.g. 
			<em>http://</em> or <em>https://</em>)
		</dd>
		
		<dt>is not</dt>
		<dd>
			Matches any URL that is not exactly the same as the URL defined in the rule. Note that this includes the 
			protocol at the start of the URL (e.g. <em>http://</em> or <em>https://</em>)
		</dd>
		
		<dt>contains</dt>
		<dd>
			Matches any URL that contains the string defined in the rule. For example, if the rule was &ldquo;contains
			facebook&rdquo; matching addresses would include <em>http://www.facebook.com/</em> and
			<em>http://example.com/facebook</em>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>begins with</dt>
		<dd>
			Matches any URL that begins with the string defined in the rule. Note that this includes the protocol at 
			the start of the URL (e.g. <em>http://</em> or <em>https://</em>). For example, if the rule was 
			&ldquo;begins with http://www.google.&rdquo; matching addresses would include 
			<em>http://www.google.com/</em>, <em>http://www.google.co.uk/</em> and 
			<em>http://www.google.com/search?q=choosy</em>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>ends with</dt>
		<dd>
			Matches any URL that begins with the string defined in the rule. For example, if the rule was &ldquo;ends
			with .pdf&rdquo; it would match any direct links to PDF files.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>is like</dt>
		<dd>
			This type of address matching allows you to define simple patterns using wildcard characters.
			
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th scope="col">Character</th>
						<th scope="col">Matches</th>
						<th scope="col">Example</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>?</td>
						<td>Any single character</td>
						<td>
							The pattern <em>a?c</em> 
							would match <em>abc</em>
							but not <em>ac</em> or <em>abbc</em>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>*</td>
						<td>Zero or more characters</td>
						<td>
							The pattern <em>a*c</em> 
							would match <em>ac</em>, <em>abc</em> and <em>abbc</em>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>matches regular expression</dt>
		<dd>
			This type of address matching allows you to define complex patterns using regular expressions. If you are
			not already familiar with regular expressions there are various websites with indepth tutorials, several of
			which are links from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions">Wikipedia article on 
			regular expressions</a>. Choosy uses the ICU version of regular expressions, you can find documentation on the 
			<a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp" title="ICU Regular Expressions documentation">ICU 
			project website</a>).
