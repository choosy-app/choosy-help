	<h1>Choosy Help: General settings</h1>
	
	<p>
		This page describes the settings on Choosy's &ldquo;General&rdquo; tab. To find these settings
		open System Preferences, click on the Choosy icon and then click on the General tab.
	</p>

	<p>
		The general settings are grouped into three sections:
	</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li><a href="#enable">Enable Choosy</a></li>
		<li><a href="#version">Version</a></li>
		<li><a href="#licence">Licence</a></li>
	</ol>
	
	<div id="enable">
		<h2>Enable Choosy</h2>
	
		<p>
			This section contains settings that allow you to enable and disable various aspects of Choosy.
		</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>Enable Choosy for links</dt>
			<dd>
				This checkbox determines whether or not Choosy will be used when clicking on links to websites.
				If you disable this option whichever browser is at the top of your Choosy browsers list (see
				<a href="../settings/browsers.html">browser settings</a>) will be set as your default browser.
				If you enable this option then Choosy will be used whenever the default browser would normally
				be used.
			</dd>
		
			<dt>Enable Choosy for HTML files</dt>
			<dd>
				This checkbox determines whether or not Choosy will be used when opening HTML files from the
				Finder. You can create <a href="../settings/advanced.html">advanced behaviour rules</a> that
				specificly target files opened from the Finder if you want custom behaviour for this type of
				file.
			</dd>
		
			<dt>Start Choosy helper at login</dt>
			<dd>
				The Choosy helper application is the app that runs whenever you click on a link and figures
				out what to do with the link (whether that's prompt you or pass it on to a browser). Having
				this app running in the background can speed things up a little bit when you click on a link.
				If you disable this option the helper application will be launched the first time that 
				Choosy is used and will continue to run in the background after that.
			</dd>
		
			<dt>Stop helper / Start helper now</dt>
			<dd>
				Allows you to stop and start the helper application as and when you need to.
			</dd>
		
			<dt>Display Choosy icon in the menu bar</dt>
			<dd>
				Allows you to display a Choosy icon at the top right of your screen in the menu bar. This
				gives you access to a menu which allows you to quickly access new versions of Choosy, 
				launch browsers and access Choosy's settings. Note that the menu bar icon will only be
				displayed while the Choosy helper application is running (so you will probably want to use
				this setting in conjunction with the &ldquo;start Choosy helper at login&rdquo; option).
				Also, the menu bar icon will always appear if there is an update available to notify you of
				the new version even if this option is disabled.
			</dd>
