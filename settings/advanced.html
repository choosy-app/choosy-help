	<h1>Choosy Help: Advanced behaviour settings</h1>

	<p>
		This page describes the settings on Choosy's &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; tab. To find these settings
		open System Preferences, click on the Choosy icon and then click on the Advanced tab.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Advanced behaviour rules allow you to set up specific behaviours that will be triggered in specific
		circumstances.

		<h2>Adding and editing rules</h2>
		<p>
			To add a rule, click on the plus button below the list of rules.
		</p>
		<p>
			To edit a rule, select the rule in the list and then click the &ldquo;Edit selected rule&rdquo;
			button on the right hand side below the list.
		</p>
		<p>
			When adding or editing rules this window will be displayed:
		</p>
		<img

			alt="A screenshot of Choosy's editing interface for advanced behaviour rules" />
		
		
		<p>
			This window contains three groups of options:
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li><a href="#edit-general">General rule settings</a></li>
			<li><a href="#edit-rule">When Choosy should use this rule</a></li>
			<li><a href="#edit-behaviour">What Choosy should do when it uses this rule</a></li>
		</ol>
		
		<div id="edit-general">
			<h3>General rule settings</h3>
			
			<dl>
				<dt>Title</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						The title setting is located at the top of the rule editing window.	It allows you to
						give the rule a name that will be displayed in the rules list. Choose something specific 
						enough to distinguish this from other rules.
					</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Enabled</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						The enabled checkbox is located at the bottom of the rule editting window. This allows
						you to disable rules without deleting them. If a rule is not enabled (i.e. if this box
						is not checked) then Choosy will ignore the rule.
					</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>
		</div>
		
		<div id="edit-rule">
			<h3>When Choosy should use this rule</h3>
		
			<p>
				This section allows you to define the conditions that must be met in order for Choosy to 
				use this rule.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The first row of the rule editor lets you select what type of rule it is, and which of the
				rules criteria (<em>any</em>, <em>all</em> or <em>none</em>) must be met for the rule to be
				triggered:<br/>
				<img 
					src="../images/rule_editor_type.png" 
					alt="A screenshot of the first row of the rule editor" />
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The subsequent rows of the rule editor show the different criteria that make up the rule.
				You can add new criteria by clicking on the plus button at the end of any row, and you can
				remove a criteron by clicking on the minus button at the end of its row:<br/>
				<img 
					src="../images/rule_editor_web_address.png" 
					alt="A screenshot of a criteron row in the rule editor" />
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The dropdown list at the beginning of the row lets you select what this criterion will match.
				The rest of the options in the row will depend on what type of criterion it is. Some types
				will have several options, others will have a text box where you can type in a value.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The following types of criteria are available:
			</p>
			
			<dl>
				<dt>Web address</dt>
				<dd>
					<img 
						src="../images/rule_editor_web_address.png" 
						alt="A screenshot of a web address criteron row in the rule editor" />
					<p>
						This allows rules to be set up for certain web sites, or groups of web sites. For
						example you could use this type of criterion to set up a rule that sends all links
						to <code>google.com</code> to <i>Firefox</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Web address criteria are very flexible: You can match exact addresses, addresses
						that start with, end with or contain certain words or even addresses that match
						patterns and regular expressions. The 
						<a href="../settings/advanced/urls.html">web address rules</a> section describes
						these options in more detail.
					</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Source application</dt>
				<dd>
					<img 
						src="../images/rule_editor_source_app.png" 
						alt="A screenshot of a source application criteron row in the rule editor" />
					<p>
						This allows rules to be created that will be triggered when you click on a link in a
						specific application. The browse button lets you pick an application from your 
						Applications folder (or elsewhere on your Mac).
					<p>
					<p>
						By selecting &ldquo;<em>is not</em>&rdquo; in the second dropdown list, you can also
						create rules that target links from all source applications except for the application
						selected in this row.
					</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Link type</dt>
				<dd>
					<img 
						src="../images/rule_editor_link_type.png" 
						alt="A screenshot of a link type criteron row in the rule editor" />
					<p>
						Link type lets you select from the following options:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>a link to a web site</li>
						<li>an HTML file on your computer</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This lets you set up rules that only apply either to HTML files on your computer, or
						to links to web sites. For example you might want to set up a custom prompt for HTML
						files on your computer that includes editing tools that wouldn't be able to open
						normal web links.
					</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Number of running browsers</dt>
				<dd>
					<img 
						src="../images/rule_editor_running_browsers.png" 
						alt="A screenshot of a running browsers criteron row in the rule editor" />
					<p>
						This lets you set up rules that only trigger when a certain number of browsers are
						running, or when more than or less than a certain number of browsers are running. 
						The second dropdown list lets you select from the following options:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>is</li>
						<li>is not</li>
						<li>is less than</li>
						<li>is greater than</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The third dropdown list lets you select a number from 0 to 10.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you click on a link the number of running browsers is calculated as the number
						of applications from your <a href="../settings/browsers.html">browsers list</a> that
						are currently running.
					</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Modifier keys</dt>
				<dd>
					<img 
						src="../images/rule_editor_modifier_keys.png" 
						alt="A screenshot of a modifier keys criteron row in the rule editor" />
					<p>
						This type of criterion lets you set up rules that are only triggered when you are
						holding down a modifier key or a combination of modifier keys when you click on 
						the link.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is useful for behaviours that you only want to occur sometimes. For example
						you could set up your <a href="../settings/behaviour.html">behaviour settings</a>
						to never prompt you to select a browser, and then set up an advanced behaviour 
						rule to prompt you to select from all browsers when you hold shift while clicking
						on a link.
					</p>
					<p>
						Modifier keys criteria can use combinations of the following keys:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>&#x21E7; Shift</li>
						<li>&#x2303; Control</li>
						<li>&#x2318; Command (sometimes called &ldquo;Apple&rdquo;)</li>
						<li>&#x2325; Option (sometimes called &ldquo;alt&rdquo;)</li>
						<li>&#x21E5; Tab</li>
						<li>&#x238B; Escape</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Custom <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> method</dt>
				<dd>
					<img 
						src="../images/rule_editor_custom_api.png" 
						alt="A screenshot of a custom API method criteron row in the rule editor" />
					<p>
						Custom API methods let you extend Choosy's API and add your own behaviours to it.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you were to create a rule that responded to a custom API method called
						&ldquo;my.rule&rdquo; you would trigger it in the same way as any other API
						method, e.g. by loading the URL <code>x-choosy://my.rule/http://www.google.com</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						The <a href="../settings/advanced/customapi.html">custom API methods</a> page 
						contains more information about creating and using your own custom API methods.
					</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>URL shortening service</dt>
				<dd>
					<img 
						src="../images/rule_editor_short_url.png" 
						alt="A screenshot of a short URL criteron row in the rule editor" />
					<p>
						This type of criteria allow you to define rules that are only triggered when Choosy
						opens a link to a URL shortening service, like bit.ly or tinyurl.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is useful when combined with the <a href="../settings/behaviour.html#short">short URL 
						expansion</a> settings. You can tell Choosy to always prompt when opening short URLs so that
						you will be able to check the expanded URL in the prompt before you open the site in a browser.
					</p>
					<p>
						A list of supported URL shortening services, and instructions for adding your own are in the
						<a href="../settings/behaviour.html#short">short URL expansion section on the behaviour page</a>.

			<h3>What Choosy should do when it uses this rule</h3>
			
			<p>
				At the bottom of the rule editing window are the rule's behaviour settings. This is where you
				tell Choosy what to do when all the rule's criteria match the link that is being clicked.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The following behaviours are available:
			</p>
			
			<dl>
				<dt>Use the default behaviour</dt>
				<dd>
					Choosy will act in accordance with your <a href="../settings/behaviour.html">behaviour
					settings</a>, just as it would have done if no advanced behaviour rules had been triggered.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Use my favourite browser</dt>
				<dd>
					Choosy will use the browser at the top of your 
					<a href="../settings/browsers.html">browsers list</a>.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Use the best running browser</dt>
				<dd>
					Choosy will use the running browser closest to the top of your
					<a href="../settings/browsers.html">browsers list</a>.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Prompt to select from all browsers</dt>
				<dd>
					Choosy will prompt you to select from all the browsers in your
					<a href="../settings/browsers.html">browsers list</a>.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Prompt to select from running browsers</dt>
				<dd>
					Choosy will prompt you to select from all the browsers in your
					<a href="../settings/browsers.html">browsers list</a> that are currently running.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Prompt to select from these browsers&hellip;</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>					
						Choosy will prompt you to select from a custom list of browsers that you set up only
						for this rule. When you select this option an interface very similar to the 
						<a href="../settings/browsers.html">browsers list</a> will appear where you can set
						up a custom browser list.
					</p>
					<img 
						src="../images/settings_advanced_behaviour_custom.png"
						alt="A screenshot of Choosy's &quot;prompt to select from these browsers&quot; interface"
						/>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Always use this browser&hellip;</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Choosy will always use the same browser. When you select this option an interface will
						appear that allows you to select the browser that Choosy should always use with this 
						rule.
					</p>
					<img 
						src="../images/settings_advanced_behaviour_specific.png"
						alt="A screenshot of Choosy's &quot;always use this browser&quot; interface"
						/>
				</dd>

				<dt>Use all of these browsers&hellip;</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Choosy will open all of the browsers you specify. The browsers will be opened in the order
						that you specify. When you select this option an interface very similar to the
						<a href="../settings/browsers.html">browsers list</a> will appear where you can set
						up a custom browser list.
					</p>
					<img
						src="../images/settings_advanced_behaviour_all.png"

				</dd>
			</dl>
			
		</div>

	</div>
	
	<div id="ordering">
		<h2>Ordering rules</h2>
		<p>
			The order of your behaviour rules is important. When more than one rule matches the current situation
			Choosy will use the rule that is nearest to the top of the list. This means that a very general rule
			would take priority over a very specific rule when both rules match but the general rule is higher
			up the list.
		</p>
		<p>
			To change the order of the rules, drag and drop each rule into a new position.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="disabling">
		<h2>Disabling rules</h2>
		
		<p>
			The checkboxes in the list of rules allow you to disable rules without removing them completely. If a
			rule's checkbox is not checked then Choosy will ignore that rule.
		</p>
